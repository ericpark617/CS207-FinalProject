# CS207-FinalProject

This project is a device which uses a laser tripwire type mechanism to send a signal to a computer to launch a certain application when the laser is interrupted. I will be using an Arduino Uno and give it Wi-fi capabilities using an ESP8266 based module. The point of this system is to launch any applications that are used daily, whenever the user walks into a room or walks to his/her computer. This is not a very practical system to actually use in real life as it only does one simple action on a computer, but it is just a fun little device to use. The path of the programs all vary, so appropriate changes mucst be made depending on the program to launch and the computer being used.
